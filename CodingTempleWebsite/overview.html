                    <h2>At Coding temple, we strive to help people reach their learning and career goals.</h2>
                    <span class="break">

                    </span>
                    <p>
                        Coding Temple is place where one can find their niche in a short amount of time. Through an accelerated learning program, our institution provides eager applicants a chance to switch up their career and hit the ground running after completion of the program. We offer full and&nbsp;part-time ASP.NET&nbsp;MVC courses. This is the overall objective at Coding Temple; to build master programmers capable of performing at the highest level of coding at any number of employers we have at our fingertips through vast networking connections and allies. A coding novice is transformed into a Professional Jr. developer. An amateur is built up into an expert. &nbsp;<span class="break">

                            <br>

                        </span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No matter the skill level of an applicant, we’re looking for all those who desire a shift in their life, a new path to blaze, talents to learn. In addition to the main course, we also offer 2-week part time and weekend boot camps. That students can take along with the 12-week course for no additional charge. As well as various other programs in the process of being formulated; iOS development, Android Application Programming, and Apache Hadoop Admin. So for those wanting to get that leg up and come into the main course tried and tested, the bootcamp provides the perfect avenue to gather the foundational basics needed to really excel at Coding Temple.<span class="break">

                            <br>

                        </span>
                    </p>
                    <p>Again, Coding Temple’s absolute, positively, number one goal is to provide students with all the skills and knowledge to not only land an Jr-level web developer position, but for them to shine and standout amongst their peers.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">What to expect:</h2>
                    <h3>Prework</h3>
                    <p>
                        <span class="break">

                            <br>

                        </span>In building Coding Temple, we’ve found that devoting time to the basics every week positively affects a students ability to grasp material down the road, which is why the pre-work is so integral to the program; it provides the necessary foundation to excel in the classroom and build a student’s ability from the ground up.<span class="para_break">

                            <br>

                        </span><br>
                        Through our experience, we’ve noticed that some schools assign a huge amount of pre-work as substitute for material that is classroom worthy. We believe that this approach to teaching does hurts a student in the long run. Learning complex subjects such as ASP.NET MVC and jQuery warrant for time to be spent in the classroom (some things are best learned within the proper setting, and for a student, it’s a precious time for hands on experience and instruction).
                    </p>
                    <h3>In Class</h3>

                    <p>
                        <span class="break">
                            <br />

                        </span>Our class is a hybrid of lecture and hands on coding. In class, you will be lectured on technologies, introduced to new concepts by explaining the fundamentals and then shown examples of how to apply them in code. You will apply these concepts yourself by writing code, while the instructors will be on standby to assist.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some days, you will be pair programming (an industry software development technique), while on other days you will be a lone wolf. The reason behind pairing is it helps assimilate knowledge faster by helping you catch each other’s mistakes, come up with new ideas which cannot be conceived by oneself, or even teach other neat tricks.</p>
